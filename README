A simple console application, called ABT, which stores data in a B-Tree.

There are 4 commands A, D, S, and Z.  

A Index  Data

This adds data to the B-Tree.  Example: A 1 test

The data cannot contain spaces.

This would add the data 'test' with an index of 1.  Overwrites existing data with same index

Returns time taken

D Index

This deletes data from B-Tree.  Example:  D 1

This would delete any data with index 1

Returns time taken.  Error message if index not present

S Index

This searches for data with an index.  Example: S 1

Return time taken and data found.

Z

This remove all data from the B-Tree.
